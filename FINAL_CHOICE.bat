git commit -m "reality: Alpha software - 30%% functional, audit exposed gaps

WORKING (verified):
- Electron app structure
- Mastodon OAuth (fixed by us)
- Database, drafts, CSV
- Basic scheduling

NOT WORKING (audit confirmed):
- Most platforms (stubs only)
- Image/video generation (missing deps)
- Analytics (fake data)
- Plugin system (empty)
- Account persistence (NULL bug)

Added honest documentation:
- HONEST_STATUS.md - reality check
- TODO_REALISTIC.md - actual requirements  
- AUDIT_RESPONSE.md - our response

This is ALPHA needing 3-6 months more work."
