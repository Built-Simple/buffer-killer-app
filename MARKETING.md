## 🤯 **Why Buffer Killer Exists**

**Buffer costs $99/month** for their "Team" plan. That's **$1,188 per year**. For scheduling posts.

**Hootsuite?** $99/month.  
**Sprout Social?** $249/month.  
**Later?** $40/month.

### **Buffer Killer? $0/month. Forever.**

No trials. No credit cards. No "free tier" with 10 posts. Just download it and own it.
