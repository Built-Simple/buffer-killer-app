# MASTODON SETUP GUIDE

## 🎉 Great News: Mastodon is FREE!

Unlike Twitter which requires a $100/month developer account, Mastodon is completely **FREE** to use! No API costs, no developer accounts needed. Just connect and start posting!

## 🐘 What is Mastodon?

Mastodon is a decentralized, open-source social network. Instead of one central server (like Twitter), there are many independent servers (called "instances") that all talk to each other. Popular instances include:

- **mastodon.social** - The flagship instance, general purpose
- **fosstodon.org** - For free & open source software enthusiasts
- **mastodon.art** - For artists and creative types
- **techhub.social** - For tech professionals
- **mas.to** - General purpose, well-moderated

## 🚀 How to Connect Mastodon

Each instance is completely independent!

### Best Practices

3. **Use content warnings** for sensitive content (coming soon)
4. **Engage with the community** - Mastodon is very community-focused

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Instance not found"
- Make sure you entered the correct URL
- Don't include `https://` or trailing slashes
- Example: `mastodon.social` not `https://mastodon.social/`

### "Authorization failed"
- Try logging into your Mastodon instance directly first
- Make sure your account isn't suspended or limited
- Some instances have stricter app permissions

### "Post failed"
- Check if your instance is having issues: https://status.mastodon.social
- Verify your account can post normally on the web
- Character limit might be exceeded
