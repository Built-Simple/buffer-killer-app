# 📝 REALISTIC TODO LIST - Based on Audit Reality

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIXES (Session 11 - Critical)

### 1. Fix npm install issues
```bash
# The sqlite3 problem
npm install --build-from-source sqlite3

# Or use better-sqlite3 instead:
npm uninstall sqlite3
npm install better-sqlite3
```

### 2. Fix account persistence bug
```javascript
// In main.js OAuth callback
// Line ~950 - Account saves but with NULL data
// Need to properly extract and save credentials
```

### 3. Update README to reality
- Remove false claims
- Mark features as "planned" not "working"
- Add "Alpha Software" warning

## 🗑️ FEATURES TO DELETE (Not Worth Building)

Based on effort vs value:

1. **Video Editing** - Too complex, use external tools
2. **AI Content** - Expensive API, limited value
3. **Team Collaboration** - Massive scope increase
4. **Plugin System** - Over-engineered for MVP
5. **10+ Image Templates** - Just do 2-3 well

---

## ✅ FEATURES TO KEEP & FINISH

Core MVP (Realistic):

1. **3 Platforms Max** (Mastodon, Twitter, GitHub)
2. **Basic Scheduling** (already works)
3. **Draft System** (already works)
4. **CSV Import** (already works)
5. **Simple Analytics** (posts made, scheduled)
6. **1-2 Image Templates** (with Puppeteer)

---

## 📊 REALISTIC TIMELINE

### Current State: 30% Complete Alpha

### 6 Week Plan to 70% Beta:
- **Week 1:** Fix critical bugs
- **Week 2:** Complete Mastodon
- **Week 3:** Complete Twitter
- **Week 4:** Real analytics
- **Week 5:** Testing & fixes
- **Week 6:** Documentation

### 3 Month Plan to 1.0:
- **Month 1:** Core features solid
- **Month 2:** Add GitHub, basic image generation
- **Month 3:** Polish, testing, documentation

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

### Alpha → Beta (You are here → 6 weeks)
- 3 platforms actually working
- No NULL data bugs
- Error handling everywhere
- Real analytics (not fake)
- Honest documentation

### Beta → 1.0 (3 months)
- 5000+ successful posts
- 100+ real users testing
- <1% error rate
- Comprehensive docs
- Installation works first try

---

## 💀 CODE TO DELETE NOW

These files are misleading/broken:
```
lib/platforms/facebook.js (dangerous)
lib/platforms/instagram.js (doesn't work)
lib/video/* (vaporware)
lib/ai/* (not started)
components/plugin-manager-ui.js (empty)
```

---

## 📝 HONEST COMMIT MESSAGES

### For current commit:
```bash
git commit -m "reality: Alpha software - 30% functional, 70% stubs

ACTUALLY WORKING (tested):
- Electron app runs
- Mastodon OAuth (we fixed)
- Database/drafts
- Basic scheduling
- CSV import/export

BROKEN/MISSING (audit confirmed):
- Most platform posting untested
- Image generation (no Puppeteer)
- Video editing (no FFmpeg)
- Analytics (fake data only)
- Account persistence bug
- npm install fails

This is ALPHA software. See HONEST_STATUS.md for reality.
Audit revealed massive gaps between claims and functionality."
```

### For README update:
```bash
git commit -m "docs: Update README with honest status - Alpha not Production

- Marked working features vs planned
- Added Alpha Software warning
- Removed false capability claims
- Added realistic timeline
- Included dependency issues"
```

---

## 🚀 NEXT SESSION FOCUS

### Session 11 Priorities:
1. Fix account persistence (NULL data)
2. Test Mastodon posting with saved account
3. Update README honestly
4. Delete or fix dangerous stubs

### Session 12-15:
- Complete one platform fully
- Add real error handling
- Create integration tests
- Update documentation

---

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Don't oversell** - Claims must match code
2. **Test everything** - "Untested" = "Broken"
3. **Handle errors** - Every API call needs try-catch
4. **Dependencies matter** - Missing deps = non-functional
5. **Alpha is alpha** - Don't pretend it's production

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**We built 30% of what we claimed.**

Time to either:
1. Build the other 70% (3-6 months)
2. Reduce claims to match the 30% (1 day)
3. Focus on making 50% work perfectly (6 weeks)

**Recommendation: Option 3 - Make half work well**
