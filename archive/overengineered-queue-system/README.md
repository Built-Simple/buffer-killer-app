# Over-Engineered Queue System (ARCHIVED)

## Why This Was Archived
This system was built with enterprise-grade failover and load balancing between multiple accounts on the same platform. However, this doesn't make sense for social media because:

1. **Different accounts = Different audiences** - You never want content randomly switching between accounts
2. **Brand confusion** - Personal vs business accounts should never mix
3. **No real use case** - Nobody runs redundant identical social media accounts

## What It Did
- Created separate queues per account with failover
- Load balanced posts across multiple accounts (WHY?!)
- Automatically switched accounts on rate limits (TERRIBLE IDEA!)
- Monitored health and blacklisted accounts

## What We Built Instead
See `/lib/accounts/` for the practical implementation:
- Account workspaces (organize accounts by client/project)
- Account switching in UI
- Separate content calendars per account
- Per-account rate limiting (kept this part)
- Team access controls

## Could Be Useful For
This architecture would actually be great for:
- Web scraping with proxy rotation
- Distributed API calls
- Load testing
- Parallel processing tasks
- Any scenario where you have truly interchangeable workers

But NOT for social media management!
