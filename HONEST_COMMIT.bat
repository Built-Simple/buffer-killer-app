echo ============================================
echo.

echo Creating honest commit...
git add .
git commit -m "reality check: Alpha software - 30%% functional, massive gaps found

An external audit revealed:
- Most claimed features don't work
- Dependencies missing (sqlite3, puppeteer, ffmpeg)
- Platform integrations mostly stubs
- Account persistence broken (NULL data)
- npm install fails for new users

ACTUALLY WORKING:
- Basic Electron app
- Mastodon OAuth (we fixed)
- Database and drafts
- CSV import/export
- Post scheduling infrastructure
- Testing framework (75%% pass but many are stubs)

NOT WORKING:
- LinkedIn (stub)
- Facebook/Instagram (dangerous stubs)
- Image generation (no Puppeteer)
- Video editing (no FFmpeg)
- Analytics (fake data)
- Plugin system (empty)
- Media upload (broken)

This commit adds:
- HONEST_STATUS.md with reality check
- TODO_REALISTIC.md with actual requirements
- README_HONEST.md with truthful claims
- Testing framework from Session 10
- IPC fixes and database utilities

This is ALPHA software needing 3-6 months more work.
See HONEST_STATUS.md for complete analysis."
