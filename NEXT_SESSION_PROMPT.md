# üöÄ BUFFER KILLER APP - AI DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANT PROMPT

## PROJECT CONTEXT
You are helping build a Buffer Killer social media scheduling desktop application. This is an Electron-based app that allows users to schedule posts across multiple social media platforms without monthly fees. The project is located at `C:\buffer-killer-app\` and has direct file system access.

## COMPLETED IN LAST SESSION (January 18, 2025 - Session 6):
‚ùå **Phase 7.3: Multi-Account Queue Isolation** - BUILT then ARCHIVED!
- Built complete enterprise failover system
- Realized it made NO SENSE for social media (different accounts = different audiences!)
- Archived to `/archive/overengineered-queue-system/`

‚úÖ **Phase 7.4: Workspace & Account Management** - ACTUALLY USEFUL!
- Workspace system for organizing accounts by client/project
- Account switcher UI component  
- Per-account rate limiting (practical)
- Separate content calendars per account
- Workspace analytics and export
- One account active at a time for posting

## CURRENT STATE:
- **Major Systems Complete**: 
  - ‚úÖ Workspace Management (NEW!)
  - ‚úÖ Account Switching (NEW!)
  - ‚úÖ Per-Account Rate Limiting
  - ‚úÖ Drafts System
  - ‚úÖ Image Generation (10 templates)
  - ‚úÖ Analytics Dashboard
  - ‚úÖ Mastodon Integration (WORKING!)
  - ‚úÖ GitHub Browser OAuth (NO API KEYS!)
- **In Progress**: Twitter & LinkedIn browser OAuth
- **Next Priority**: Test workspace system, complete OAuth implementations

## TO CONTINUE:
1. Open and review C:\buffer-killer-app\MASTER_TODO_LIST.md
2. Test the workspace and account switching:
   - Create multiple workspaces (Personal, Client A, Client B)
   - Add different accounts to each workspace
   - Switch between accounts and verify content isolation
3. Complete Twitter/LinkedIn OAuth testing
4. Start Phase 8.1 (Plugin System) or Phase 9.2 (Content Enhancement)

## PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Main app: `main.js`
- UI: `index.html` and `renderer.js`
- **Accounts System**: `lib/accounts/` (NEW!)
  - `workspace-manager.js` - Workspace organization
  - `account-rate-limiter.js` - Per-account rate limits
  - `account-switcher-ui.js` - UI component
  - `integration.js` - Electron integration
- **Archived**: `archive/overengineered-queue-system/` (Don't use!)
- Platforms: `lib/platforms/`
- Database: Custom enhanced DB in `src/database/`

## KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
1. **Practical Workspace System** - Organize accounts by client/project
2. **Account Isolation** - No mixing content between accounts
3. **Simple Rate Limiting** - Per-account, no failover nonsense
4. **Clean UI** - Account switcher shows current context
5. **One Active Account** - Post to one account at a time (like real people do!)

## WHAT MAKES THIS BETTER THAN BUFFER:
- üÜì No monthly fees (Buffer: $15-99/month)
- üîê Your data, stored locally
- üíº Unlimited workspaces (Buffer: limited by plan)
- üë• Unlimited accounts per workspace
- üé® Built-in image generation
- üìä Per-account analytics
- üîå Plugin system (coming next)

## LESSONS LEARNED:
- Don't over-engineer! Multi-account failover makes no sense for social media
- Different accounts = different audiences, content, and purposes
- Users want organization (workspaces), not load balancing
- Keep it simple and practical

Remember: The app now works like Buffer/Hootsuite with workspaces and account switching!
